Tips :

1. Do not add a lot of flour or starch to the mixed veggies as they make the manchurian balls hard. Instead you can add bread crumbs.

2. Adding too much of bread crumbs will alter the taste of the balls. You should not have the dominating taste of bread in the balls. So add more only if needed.

3. The manchurian balls can be fried in the paniyaram pan, just skip the flour and beans. Use only the bread crumbs. Fry them on a medium flame turning them all around for even cooking.

4. If frying the balls in the paniyaram pan then, ensure you do not make the balls too big. I cook these in a cast iron pan so they cook well inside but I am not sure if they turn out good in a non stick.

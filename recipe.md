Preparing for veg manchurian
1. It is good not to use vegetables from refrigerator as they let out lot of moisture and the veg balls will not turn crispy. I usually keep the veggies out of refrigerator the previous day.

2. Cut cabbage to large cubes and add them to luke warm water. Allow to rest for 3 to 4 mins. Drain completely and allow to air dry until used. Chop finely. I prefer to air dry on a cotton cloth after chopping.
Prepare veggies for balls
1¼ cups cabbage fine chopped
¼ cup spring onions fine chopped
¼ cup beans (optional) fine chopped
½ cup grated carrot (1 medium)
2 tablespoons grated or minced bell peppers
Grate 2 garlic cloves and half inch ginger (1 teaspoon paste).

3. Prepare veggies for the sauce
fine chop ½ tablespoon ginger & ¾ tablespoon garlic
¼ cup spring onions fine chopped
¼ cup bell peppers chopped

Making veg balls

4. Before you begin to make the balls, begin to heat the oil in a kadai / deep pan. If you do not intend to use bread crumbs in the recipe, this step is very crucial.
The balls that are made without using bread crumbs have to straight away go for frying else they will let out moisture and the balls will not turn crispy or may even break.

5. Add chopped cabbage, carrot, beans,capsicum and spring onions to a mixing bowl. Next add very little salt, ½ teaspoon pepper and ginger garlic paste. Do not add more salt as it will let out more moisture from the veggies.

6. Then add cornstarch (corn flour) and all-purpose flour (maida).

7. Mix gently to bind the ingredients.

8. Make the balls without squeezing the mixture a lot. These balls will be soft and you may also need to grease your palms if the mixture is sticky.
But if the balls do not hold shape, then it is not good to go ahead and fry as they may break in the oil.
Some variety of veggies especially tender ones, frozen or from cold storage let out lot of moisture and will break the balls while frying.

Bread crumbs for manchurian balls

9. You can also add bread crumbs for extra crisp texture. If you intend to make this for a party, then do use them. This will help the balls to remain crisp for at least 2 hours. You can make these ahead and dunk in the sauce just before serving.
Veg manchurian balls made without bread crumbs are good to serve immediately after making as they do not remain crisp for longer. Any amount of cornstarch or maida / plain flour will not do the job of bread crumbs.

10. These balls will be firmer and less sticky. For this recipe you will get about 12 to 14 balls depending on the size.

Frying balls for manchurian recipe

11. Heat oil in a kadai. Gently slide a small portion of dough to the oil to check if it is hot enough. The dough has to rise steadily without browning. This is the right temperature. Fry veg balls immediately on a medium flame. Leave them untouched until they firm up in the oil, if you have not used bread crumbs. Later stir often to fry them evenly.

12. Drain them to a kitchen tissue when they turn golden and crisp. These balls take long time to fry, so it is good to discard the oil used for frying

13. I prefer my Indo chinese dishes to be brighter in color rather than brownish so I use red chili powder or paste. This is optional. You can make a fine paste of kashmiri chilies or mix little chilli powder with very little water. Set this aside.

14. Dissolve corn starch
For veg Manchurian gravy: Dissolve ¾ tablespoon of cornstarch with ¼ cup of water.
Manchurian dry: Dissolve 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoon of water. Set this aside.

Making manchurian sauce

15. Heat up a pan with 1½ tablespoons of fresh oil. Saute chopped garlic and ginger until for a min.

16. Add spring onions and finely chopped capsicum. Saute for 1 to 2 mins on the highest flame possible without burning. This lends a unique aroma to the sauce.

17. Lower the flame completely. Add soya sauce or tamari. You can add more or less to suit your taste.

18. Add red chili sauce (or any hot sauce) and ketchup (optional). Adjust to suit your taste.

19. This step is optional. Stir the red chili paste and pour it. Use a milder variety chili powder like kashmiri.

20. Make sure the flame is low. Stir the cornstarch mixture and pour it to the pan.

21. Next stir immediately.

22. Pour 1 cup water for gravy version and half cup water for dry version and stir well. I am making a gravy here.

23. Taste this and then add vinegar, sugar, pepper & salt, everything to suit your taste. The manchurian sauce has to be slightly sour, sweet and very very mildly hot.

24. Keep stirring and cook on a medium flame until the sauce thickens. Sauce will thicken upon cooling. So the right consistency is when it is slightly thick.

Making veg manchurian
25. Do not add the balls to very hot sauce. Allow it to cool down a bit for about 5 to 7 mins. Add the balls to the manchurian sauce just before you serve. If the sauce turns very thick, you can add little hot water and stir.
Garnish veg manchurian with spring onions.
